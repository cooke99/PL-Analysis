# Premier-League-Analysis

This repository documents my attempt to win my Fantasy Premier League mini-league using data analytics and machine learning.

Data is sourced from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League, which I have forked to my own repository.

Tableau dashboard for 2023/24 season data produced by me is available here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.cooke/viz/FPLDashboard20232024/Dashboard202324Season

As of GW10, I am currently second in the leaderboard, trailing first place by 24 points, having overcome a 70 point deficit from GW1 (I joined FPL in GW2).

This repository contains the following folders:

* data fixes : Contains SQL scripts and data files that were fixed from the original data source.
* documents : Contains reference material I've used to guide me during the analysis.
* plots : Contains any figures produced from the analysis.
* Python : Contains all Python scripts and analysis notebooks.
* results : Any results produced by the analyses are stored here.
* Tableau dashboards : Contains original Tabbleau workbooks.
